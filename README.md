# Project-Real-Estate-Manager

https://realezmanager.herokuapp.com/

Our project was centered around building a lightweight business management tool for Real Estate Agents. This application will allow the agent to enter and manage a data set, which will then fuel interactive dashboards with important KPIs. There will also be a predictive machine learning component that will allow the agent to plug in a few common property attributes and render a suggested final sale price based on historical data.
